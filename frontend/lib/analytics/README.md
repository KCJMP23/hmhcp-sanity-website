# Healthcare Content A/B Testing Framework

## Overview
This framework provides a specialized A/B testing solution for healthcare content, focusing on medical compliance, statistical significance, and patient-centric metrics.

## Key Features
- Medical Compliance Validation
- Statistical Significance Calculator
- Healthcare-Specific Success Metrics
- Bayesian Inference for Experiment Analysis

## Experiment Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Define content variants with medical compliance levels
2. **Validation**: Automatic medical terminology and accuracy checks
3. **Tracking**: Monitor healthcare-specific success metrics
4. **Analysis**: Determine winning variant with high confidence

## Compliance Levels
- **Low**: Basic content validation
- **Medium**: Rigorous medical terminology checks
- **High**: Strict medical accuracy validation
- **Critical**: AI-powered comprehensive compliance review

## Success Metrics
- Medical Professional Engagement
- Patient Understanding
- Content Accuracy
- Conversion Rate

## Usage Example
```typescript
const experiment: ABExperiment = {
  title: 'Patient Education Content Optimization',
  contentType: 'medical_guide',
  medicalComplianceLevel: 'high',
  primaryVariant: { ... },
  secondaryVariant: { ... },
  successMetrics: { ... }
};

// Validate and run experiment
const complianceResult = validateMedicalCompliance(experiment.primaryVariant, 'high');
const significanceResult = calculateStatisticalSignificance(experiment);
const winner = determineWinningVariant(experiment);
```

## Best Practices
- Always validate medical compliance
- Use conservative significance thresholds
- Consider patient safety in content variations
- Continuously monitor and update content based on results

## Limitations
- Requires manual review for critical medical content
- AI compliance checks are supplementary, not definitive
- Statistical analysis should complement clinical expertise

## Future Improvements
- Integration with medical literature databases
- Enhanced AI-powered compliance validation
- Real-time content adjustment based on experiment results
